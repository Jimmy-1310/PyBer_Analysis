# PyBer_Analysis

## Overview

During this module, I was tasked with the job of creating visualizations based on the data of a small driving company. During the module, I was able to create a variety of graphs such as pie charts, box plots and sactter plots. This visualizations helped us understand the relation and how the data correlate with each other. It was pretty clear to contrast and compare the diference between the apps performance in the different types of cities it worked on.
The challenge consisted of creating a graph that helped understand the performance of each city type in terms of total fare through several weeks. For this I needed to devide and store the total fare for each city type and store it by weeks, in order to be avaible to graph it. Once the data was stored in a data frame with the week as the index, the city type as the columns and the total fare as the values, I was able to create a graph that will facilitate decision making in the future.

For this project I learned to use Matplotlib.pyplot to create visualizations. I was also able to costumize this visualizations to make them easier to read and tell the real storie the data is telling us. Laslty, I was also able to build upon previous python and pandas knowledge to calculate means, group dataframes,etc. With this experience, it is now easiero to understand the value libraries like pandas or numpy bring to a data analyst.
